        I've been to the Hague four times already. It's my most visited foreign city actually. Last time I went, I was not preoccupied with doing touristic things - I wanted to simply enjoy myself in the area. I've made a list of five things to highlight from the trip to share.

        If you're visiting Holland in the spring, ideally late April or early May, I'd highly recommend making a trip to the Keukenhof Gardens. It's a botanical garden that's overdosed on flowers. Pay attention to the local weather and try your best to figure out when the tulips are blooming as they are majority of the park (or, so it seemed). Additionally, the Keukenhof is located right next to flower fields which are just rows and rows of colour coordinated flower strips.

          The whole place smells so nice and even though it can be busy even during a weekday it's a must. Take at least 3 or 4 hours to walk through the park. Bring a book and hang out on the lawns; bring a friend and stroll around aimlessly. I promise you, after about 30 minute you will be sick of taking photos of flower.

          The garden is massive. There is even a large pond and a windmill which you can climb. (I was very set on finding a windmill my last trip which is why you can see me hugging one in the middle photo below ^_^) I think the best part of Keukenhof was being overwhelmed by the mount of flowers and their composition. It was truly beautiful. I do want to give advice about going to the Keukenhof: take your time. There is a lot to see and it's doable even if there is a crowd. This is al about nature and literally stopping to smell the roses so don't rush and try not to waste all your energy on photos in the first 30 min and you'll have a grand time. Promise.
