      The rumors are all true! About the creative scene. The artists. And, yes, the coffee as well. Portland has its own TV show, Portlandia, that is lovingly poking fun at Hipsters on their fixed-gear bikes, at coffee nerds that put all their time and effort into the perfect cold drip brew, and at jewelry designers-turned organic farmers (or the other way around) who stroll through the neighborhoods.
    </p>
    <p>
      While all that is true, there is also a different quality about the city. Portland feels like a small town, <a href="#">with big city possibilities</a>. There's great design to be discovered, lots of fashion to be admired, and music to be heard. And don't even get us started on the amazing restaurant scene... Let's spend 12hrs in Portland!

      This design hotel has a lot of things going for it: Its location is right in the middle of Burnside, a great neighborhood full of small stores and good restaurants. And right next door, across the patio is the Doug Fir Lounge, one of Portland's best concert venues. There are shows by great bands almost every night, just have a look at their schedule. Also, the lounge and restaurant inside serves great, elevated diner food. And no worries, we'll pay a visit to the Ace later today!

      On the opposite side of your hotel, nestled together in one big building block, are several great shops. There's 'Bombshell Vintage' for the thrift lover, Sword+Fern, a design studio and lovingly curated (fashion) shop, Nationale, an art gallery and exhibition space, Haunt, a shop specializing in Women's wear and jewelry and Stand Up Comedy (pictured above), that sells "clothing, print matter and objects", offering some hard to find treasures. Get a first taste of the Portland vibe here, and then let's head over to the city.

      Portland is a city that loves its coffee. So for breakfast, we are heading down Burnside Street to visit Heart Coffee Roasters. It's a beautiful cafe that also offers snacks for breakfast, but - just like the name suggest - it's also a coffee roaster. The big machine right in the middle of the room gives off a heavenly smell. Have a seat, and slowly start your day. Afterwards, walk back to the Jupiter and keep your eyes open for some nice shops along the way.
